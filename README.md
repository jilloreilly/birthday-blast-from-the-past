## Description

Welcome to Birthday Blast from the Past! ðŸŽ¬âœ¨

Birthday Blast from the Past is a collaborative web application project, brought to you by Lisa Spencer, Jill O'Reilly, Sarah Egleston, and Leone Dale. Together, we've crafted an application that combines personal information with movie data to create a nostalgic journey through time.

2. Movie Data Retrieval: Uses the TheMovieDB API to fetch information about the top movie from the specified birth year. The retrieved data includes the movie's name, release date, and poster.
